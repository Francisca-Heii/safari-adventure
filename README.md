#### Site Scope :
*The following must be incorporated:*
* Easy and intuitive to navigate.
* Carousel image with text sliders for Chobe National Park and the Okavango Delta.
* A responsive design that will present information in a logical format on all devices.
* Apropriate branding and color palette
* A geolocated map on the home screen showing the Okavango Delta and Chobe National park.
* A Video on the home page and wildlife displayed via tooltip on hover or mouse pointer in the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park pages.
* Banner images on places to explore.

#### Structure Plane :
*The site can be used on Mobile, Tablet or desktop, it was designed on mobile first approch.*
Each page has the same structure :
* The logo is on the left and the navigation bar in the center.
* The main body of the page contains the relevant information.
* Footer at the bottom of the page containg social media links and copyright text.

#### Skeleton Plane: 
I started with a **_pen and paper to draw my wireframes,_** but ultimately were created using **_Figma._** Each page of the application was rendered as a wireframe in **_diffrent screen sizes_** to show how elements per page would react to **_different viewport sizes_**. Each element put down on this stage has made it into the **_physical development_** of the application with slight changes occuring from the original wireframes.
